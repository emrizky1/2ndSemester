3. it's for checking condition whether j is not negative and the current vcalue (J) are bigger than the key. If both conditions are true then the current value is shifted to the right.
4. this is where the current value get shifted to the right.

# Labs #2 Sorting Using an Array of Objects

## 6.3.3 Verification of Experiment Results

## 6.3.4 Questions
**Answers**
1. because the largest value will be in its correct position eventually, there's no need to check again for the largest value.
2. because we don't go beyond the unsorted part of the array, the last i are already sorted, so there is no need to check it again.
3. idx = 50, so idx - 1 = 49
4. You can see the modified version at UpdStudentDemo20.java

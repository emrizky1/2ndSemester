**Brief Explanation**
1. Input nim.
2. The program will extract the last two digits from the nim.
3. If the extracted number less than 10, then it will adds 10 to ensure it more than 10.
4. The program runs a loop from 1 till nimn.
5. inside the loop, the program will skip number 6 and 10, prints (*) for odd number, and print even number.

## 2.3.1 Array

**Brief Explanation**
1. Input score according to the course.
2. Convert numerical grade into alphabetical grade.
3. Convert alphabetical grade into grade score.
4. Multiply grade score with sks accordingly (totPoint).
5. Total all sks.
6. Display each course's scores (numerical, alphabetical, grade(bobot)).
7. Display the GPA by calculate totPoint divided by total sks.
